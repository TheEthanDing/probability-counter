I want to be able to explore various logical and mathematic fallacies that I've wanted to try out, which don't make a lot of intuitive sense, one of the first that came to mind was the Martingale Betting System, but after finishing it, I realized I definitely coded it incorrectly, so I will go back and change that. 

Will probably also dig into a tutorial about how to make a GUI for that process.
